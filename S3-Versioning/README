Versioning saves the historical features in your objects for data safety and security reasons. When multiple users are working on one specific project, accidental overwrite and deletion can be made to an object which could produce unwanted results to the project. Enabling versioning on a bucket will prevent unwanted overwrites or deletions as users will be able to recover their data by grabbing previous versions of the object.
To enable this, the AWSCLI will be needed. Refer to this link for further information: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/
